- Try to replace `.candy-auto` with `.candy-prose`

  - maybe just `<a>` to start?

  - i could see the case for `h1, h2, etc`

  - maybe tables because markdown supports those...

    - but i could always add that in later if i ever care (i probably won't)

- Support `[aria-disabled="true"]` in addition to `:disabled`

- Add a `.candy-field` wrapper for text fields?
